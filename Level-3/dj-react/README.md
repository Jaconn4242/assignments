This was a fun one!  Sure the styling could use some work but my main challenge here was accomplished :).  I wanted to be able to get comfortable with using audio files inside of click events as well as using custom hooks to render different background styles depending on which buttons were clicked by the user.  So much can be done with this type of functionality, hope you like it and don't forget to unmute your computer speakers!
